This site uses the OMDb API

The OBDb (Open Movie Database) is a Web Service to get information on films (posters, titles, stars, directors, release dates, etc.) that uses a RESTful architecture to serve its resources.

The requests are made by URL and the responses are in JSON.

It is developed by Brian Fritz: https://www.patreon.com/omdb
